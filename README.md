The backbone of this system is MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance.

## 🧐 Why MongoDB for a Social Media Platform? 🧐
*"When you could also just use SQL?  (｡·  v  ·｡)? ..."*

### 🛠 Dynamic & Adaptable Schema
- **Why It Rocks:** In the ever-changing world of social media, nothing stays the same. With this idea in mind I chose MongoDB's because of its flexible schema which means FortiChat can easily evolve. *New features? Different post types? No problem!* 
- **In Simple Words:** It's like having a backpack that magically expands to fit everything, no matter how much stuff you add. ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ

### 🌌 Handling Diverse Data with Ease
- **Why It's Awesome:** Posts, comments, images, likes - social media is a wild mix of data. MongoDB handles this variety effortlessly, letting FortiChat store and manage all sorts of content.
- **Put Simply:** It’s like a wizard's hat that can hold anything from a rabbit to a bouquet of flowers - all at once! ₍ᐢ. .ᐢ₎ ₊˚⊹♡

### 🚀 Scalability That Grows
- **The Cool Factor:** As more users join FortiChat, MongoDB grows as well! It's built to handle tons of data and users without breaking a sweat.
- **In Human Terms:** Imagine a party where everyone's invited, and the room magically gets bigger as more friends pile in. *ੈ✩‧₊˚

### ⚡ Fast Development & Iteration
- **Why We Love It:** I want to continue tinkering and improving FortiChat. MongoDB’s developer-friendly setup lets me roll out updates quickly.
- **Plain Speak:** It's like cooking in a well-organized kitchen - everything you need is right there, making it a breeze to whip up something new. ‧₊˚ ⋅  𓐐𓎩 ‧₊˚ ⋅

### 📡 Real-Time Data for Instant Connections
- **The Wow Factor:** What’s social media without the 'social' part? MongoDB helps me deliver real-time updates and notifications, keeping the FortiChat community buzzing.
- **In Everyday Words:** It's like having a conversation where replies come instantly - no awkward pauses or delays. ৻( •̀ ᗜ •́ ৻)

### 🤔 So, Why Not SQL?
- **Here's the Deal:** SQL is great, but it's like a well-oiled machine with fixed parts - not ideal for the spontaneity and fluidity of what I had an idea in mind for this project. I also wanted to further develop my NoSQL (specifically MongoDB) skills, but that was besides the point.
- **Bottom Line:** I chose MongoDB because it's like a living, breathing organism that adapts and grows with the community. (๑ᵕ◡ᵕ)(ˆ◡ˆc)

# 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide 🚀
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/6348/6348248.png" width="20%" height="20%">
</p>

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the FortiChat project on your local machine. Before starting, ensure you have Node.js installed and a MongoDB instance ready for use.

## Step 1: Install Node.js ⬇️
Node.js is essential for running the JavaScript backend.
- Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- For a quick start guide on Node.js, visit [Getting Started with Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).

## Step 2: Clone the Repository 🧬
```
git clone https://github.com/AGiljanovic/FortiChat.git
cd FortiChat
```
## Step 3: Install Dependencies 🚸
- Install the required npm packages for both frontend and backend.
- Navigate to the frontend and backend directories in separate terminal windows.
- Run ```npm install``` in each directory to install the dependencies listed in package.json.
- Frontend [packages](https://github.com/AGiljanovic/FortiChat/blob/main/client/package.json)
- Backend [packages](https://github.com/AGiljanovic/FortiChat/blob/main/server/package.json)

## Step 4: MongoDB Setup 🗄️
To store and manage application data, set up a MongoDB instance. 
- If you don't have MongoDB, download and install it from [MongoDB Official Site](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- For guidance on setting up MongoDB, refer to [MongoDB Installation Guide.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

## Step 5: Configure .env File ⚙️
- Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and fill in the details:
  
```
MONGO_URL = ""
PORT = 3001
JWT_SECRET = ""
MONGO_DB_NAME = ""
```
- `MONGO_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `PORT`: The port on which the backend server will run.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JWT tokens.
- `MONGO_DB_NAME`: Name of your MongoDB database.

There is also one .env on the front end, which was meant for deployment, which was abandoned, however it still has to be set up.
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL= https://smedia-fortichat.onrender.com
```

## Step 6: Run the Application 🚩
With the setup complete, you can now run the application:
- In the backend directory, run `node index.js` to start the backend server.
- In the frontend directory, run `npm start client` to launch the React application.

## Populate the Database with Initial Data ➕
- To have some initial data in the application, you can populate your database with predefined users and posts. This step is optional but recommended for a better initial experience with FortiChat.
- In the `index.js` file of the backend directory, uncomment the following lines:
```
// Import models and initial data
import User from "./models/user.js";
import Post from "./models/post.js";
import { users, posts } from "./data/index.js";

// Add data to the database (Run this only once to avoid duplicates)
User.insertMany(users);
Post.insertMany(posts);
```
- Save the changes and run your backend server. This will insert the initial users and posts into your MongoDB database.
- **Important:** Once the data is successfully added, comment out these lines again to prevent duplicate entries if you restart the server.
```
// Prevent duplicate data insertion
// User.insertMany(users);
// Post.insertMany(posts);
```
- Restart your backend server to continue with the normal operation of the application.
<br>
Now, your FortiChat application should have some preloaded data to interact with! ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و ♡
